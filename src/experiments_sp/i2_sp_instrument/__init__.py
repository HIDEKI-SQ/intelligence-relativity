"""I-2: SP Instrument Validation Experiments.

Experiments:
    - SP-00: Identity & Isometry (rotation, scale → SP ≈ 1)
    - SP-01: Full Destruction (random relayout → SP ≈ 0)
    - SP-02: Controlled Topology Disruption (edge rewiring curve)
    - SP-03: Layout Robustness (generalization across layouts)
